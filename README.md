# Password cracker: a test of the reliability of passwords for online security
This repository is a file collection comprising my Bachelor Semester Project developed during Semester 1 at the University of Luxembourg (September 2021 - January 2022).

The project focuses on assessing the security of passwords commonly used on the Internet. It evaluates how reliable these passwords are in today's digital landscape and uses academic research to support its findings. Additionally, the project includes a Python program that simulates an attack attempting to guess user passwords, providing a visual example of potential vulnerabilities.
