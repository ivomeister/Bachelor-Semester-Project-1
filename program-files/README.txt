- algorithm.py - contains source code used for the password-cracking algorithm (runs in console)
- gui.pyw - contains source code used for the program.exe file (implementation of gui + integration of algorithm inside the gui code)
- passlist.txt - 10 million password list used in the algorithm (credit: https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10-million-password-list-top-1000000.txt)
- important_info.txt - cosmetic file that opens automatically if a password is found; contains made up personal data of a non-existing person
